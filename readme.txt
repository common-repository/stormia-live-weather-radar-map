The Stormia plugin let's you embed an interactive weather map onto your website, visualizing live satellite + radar for anywhere in the world.

== Description ==

Show your visitors a live weather radar showing rain/snow/clouds and thunder on a precise and beautifully animated, interactive map! Perfect for any website that is weather related.

To embed Stormia, simply use this shortcode: [stormia width="800" height="500"] ( optionally, you may provide lat and lon parameters in the short-code to center the map at a given location )

Stormia is completely free for you to embed on your site and visualizes the most precise weather radar & forecasts available for the US.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Find the latitude and longitude for your desired location (you can google them), or leave empty for user location
4. Embed your Live Radar map using our shortcode: [stormia width="800" height="500"] or [stormia width="800" lat="40.71" lon="-74.01"]
